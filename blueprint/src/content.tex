% In this file you should put the actual content of the blueprint.
% It will be used both by the web and the print version.
% It should *not* include the \begin{document}
%
% If you want to split the blueprint content into several files then
% the current file can be a simple sequence of \input. Otherwise It
% can start with a \section or \chapter for instance.

This will contain the blueprint for our joint project once it is chosen.

\begin{definition}[Immersion]
  \label{def:immersion}
  \lean{Immersion}
  \leanok
  An Immersion is a map that is an immersion.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}[Main lemma]
  \label{lem:main}
  \uses{def:immersion}
  \lean{main_lemma}
  \leanok
  This is the statement of the main lemma
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is missing.

\begin{theorem}[Smale 1958]
  \label{thm:sphere_eversion}
  \lean{sphere_eversion}
  \leanok
  \uses{def:immersion, lem:main, def:immersion}
  There is a homotopy of immersions of $ùïä^2$ into $‚Ñù^3$ from the inclusion map to
  the antipodal map $a : q ‚Ü¶ -q$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  \uses{thm:open_ample, lem:open_ample_immersion}
  This obviously follows from what we did so far.
\end{proof}
